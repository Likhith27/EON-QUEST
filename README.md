The player's objective is to find a lost artifact—a green weapon(poison staff)—by entering a location through a portal. There are three primary regions to explore, and each one is defended by dragons, skull-headed demons, and demons possessing fire, earth, and ice abilities. Once the quest is complete, the game is over, and you can go back to the portal after you've found the missing artifact.
